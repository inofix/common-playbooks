#*  This playbook creates a vm on a KVM host (via virt-install for now).
#* Currently only debian jessie on amd64 via preseed is supported, extending
#* should not be too difficult, but we had to start somewhere..
#*  The playbook is intended to be used by 'maestro', which gets the necessary
#* host and vm info from the knowledge base (reclass-inventory).
#*  Use '-a' to pass parameters to ansible (as '-e'). See ansible fetch for
#* details.
#*  The following arguments are mandatory:
#*   - 'new__hostname'
#*   - 'host' (dict)

- hosts: host.KVM
  vars:
    new: '{{ host.resource[new__hostname] }}'
  roles:
    - create_vm

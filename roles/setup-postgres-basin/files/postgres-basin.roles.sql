-- # create roles and permissions

-- TODO:
-- The uncommented roles are not yet used and are candidates for
-- policy based IAM in a hybrid setup, so we might want to create
-- a template here and make it optional, resp. configurable.
-- The supplier and the main_admin at least, will remain role based
-- for the supplier we do not want too much overhead, the main_admin
-- should be as low tech as possible, IMO.

-- idempotent version..

#*  This playbook makes sure the cronjob for acme-tiny is ready for a certain
#* domain, that is declared by 'app__acme__tiny__domain'.
#*  Note: this playbook has a 'weak' dependency to setup-lets-encrypt, what
#* means that playbook must be run at least once before.
#*  Use '-a' to pass parameters to ansible (as '-e'). See ansible fetch for
#* details.
#*  The following arguments are mandatory:
#*   - 'app__acme__tiny__domain'
#*  If a certain hosts covers more than one certificate, it might be run
#* multiple times, e.g. by issuing some command like:
#*   `maestro.sh -b -H host ansible-play-loop re-install-acme-cron \
#*              "app__acme__tiny__domain=certificate.main:certificate.mail"`

# Do only on hosts with the acme-tiny application actually installed
#TODO disabled for now
#- hosts: app.acme.tiny
#  become: True
#  roles:
#    - { role: zwischenloesung.acme-tiny-cron }

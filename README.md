Common Playbooks
================

This playbook collection is thought to be used together with 'maestro' and the corresponding reclass inventory.

The state of this collection is: "first do it". In the next iteration, now that we start to understand ansible more and more, the roles written here will be moved to Ansible Galaxy, and mostly only the plain playbooks will remain here.

Requirements
------------

* Ansible =2.1
* Maestro
* our reclass inventory - a public version will be released, containing the very basics, to help starting new projects

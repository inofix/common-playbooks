#*  This playbook installs and prepares everything for acme.sh. The domains
#* to work with are provided as 'app__acme__certificates'. There is one dict
#* in that dict, it lists all available domains and their resp. configs, and
#* a list of domains to actively use.
#*  Note: this playbook should be used either from the main install playbook
#* (which resolves its dependencies) or as a shorthand for an already set up
#* system, where the dependencies are already provided.
#*  Use '-a' to pass parameters to ansible (as '-e'). See ansible fetch for
#* details.
#*  The following arguments are mandatory:
#*   - 'app__acme__certificates.available'
#*   - 'app__acme__certificates.enabled'

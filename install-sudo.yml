#*  This playbook wrapps the apt (and others maybe in the future..) module
#* to install software considered basic here - i.e. to be installed on every
#* host (non minimal/embedded..). It is the first one in the row and thus
#* has no dependencies.
#*  Use '-a' to pass parameters to ansible (as '-e'). See ansible fetch for
#* details.
#*  No arguments are mandatory.
